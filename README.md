Caesar Cipher


Introduction
This project is a Caesar Cipher implemented in Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. 
Despite its simplicity, the Caesar Cipher is a useful educational tool for understanding encryption and cryptography basics.

Features
Encrypt Text: Shifts each letter in the plaintext by a specified number of positions to generate ciphertext.
Decrypt Text: Reverses the shift to convert ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
Supports Upper and Lower Case Letters: Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, converting into lowercase in the output.
